Qaraaoun Reservoir Volume Estimation from Aerial Images is an essential building block to enable scientists and researchers understand the hydrological dynamics of the largest water reservoir in Lebanon. In this project, we combined advanced image processing and machine learning techniques, LandSat 1-9 and Sentinel-2 imageries to provide the first 50+ Years time-series of water volume of the Qaraaoun reservoir.  

[Dashboard](http://geoai.cnrs.edu.lb/qaraaoun) is being autonomously updated on a daily basis. This work was kindly supported by [SEALACOM](http://www.cnrs.edu.lb/english/call-of-interest/calls-for-proposals-by-cnrs/sealacom-call-for-researchers).


## Disclaimer
We relied on both water-observatory [front-end](https://github.com/sentinel-hub/water-observatory-frontend) and [back-end](https://github.com/sentinel-hub/water-observatory-backend) while developping this project.
